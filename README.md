## Operators
### Arithmetic Operators
* \+ squish
* \- rip
* \/ break
* many
* %
* ++ little squish
* --
* ** many many

### Relational Operators
* == is is 
* <= 
* >=
* <
* >
* !=

### Logical Operator
* &&
* ||
* !

### Bitwise Operators
* &	Binary AND Operator copies a bit to the result if it exists in both operands.	(A & B) = 12, i.e., 0000 1100
* |	Binary OR Operator copies a bit if it exists in either operand.	(A | B) = 61, i.e., 0011 1101
* ^	Binary XOR Operator copies the bit if it is set in one operand but not both.	(A ^ B) = 49, i.e., 0011 0001
* *~	Binary One's Complement Operator is unary and has the effect of 'flipping' bits.	(~A ) = ~(60), i.e,. -0111101
* <<	Binary Left Shift Operator. The left operands value is moved left by the number of bits specified by the right operand.	
* >>	Binary Right Shift Operator. The left operands value is moved right by the number of bits specified by the right
