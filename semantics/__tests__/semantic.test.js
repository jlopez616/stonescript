      Introduction: Here are tests check to make this 
      primitive language correctly accept this hideous
      program that happily passes the semantic 
      constraints set by our language.
      PS: This is an elaborate copy paste of the first
      multiline comment of this file :D

      TODO: "Tablets" and "fields" are not currently 
      implemented for the sake of this homework.

BEDROCK COUNTERS x IS 5!
BEDROCK CAVE emptyArray IS CAVEIN CAVEOUT!
ROCK WORDERS s IS "welcome"!

YABBADABBADOO (WORDERS intro, COUNTERS count) PART
	intro IS "My name is "!
    count IS 10!
    ðŸ¦– Will loop ten times, printing "kratos" each time
    FOR (ROCK COUNTERS i IS 0! i NOT SMASH 10! i IS i SQUISH 1) PART
    	SPEAK(kratos)!        
    NOT PART!
    GIVE WHAT!
NOT PART!

ROCK COUNTERS score IS 80!
YABBADABBADOO () PART
    OOF (score SMASH OR IS 90) PART
    SPEAK("Great job!")! 
    NOT PART OOOF (score SMASH OR IS 80) PART
    SPEAK("Not bad.")!
    NOT PART OOOF (score SMASH OR IS 70) PART
    SPEAK("You can do better.")!

    score IS score RIP 1!
NOT PART!

ROCK CAVE characters IS CAVEIN "Mimir", "Laufey", "Atreus", "Fafnir" CAVEOUT!
SPEAK(SIZE(characters))!

ROCK WORDERS shoutout IS "Isn't STONESCRIPT rocking awesome?!"!
SPEAK(GOHIGH(shoutout))!

ROCK WORDERS waitASec IS "Wait, you want string length? Ah, whoops!"!
SPEAK(DALENGTH(waitASec))!

ROCK COUNTERS randomNum IS 100!
bigop IS randomNum SQUISH 100 CUT 10 MANY 5 RIP 69 RIP 1 SQUISH 470 MANY 2 CUT 1000!
ðŸ¦– output: 1

ROCK YESNOS funbool IS OOGA!
WHILE (NOT funbool) PART 
    ðŸ¦– Infinite loop? Nahhhhhh
